            Keriko Secondary School's Br. Peter Tabichi won the prestigious Global Teacher Prize,
            becoming the first teacher from Africa to receive this honor. The award, which comes with a
            $1 million prize, recognizes exceptional teachers who have made outstanding contributions to the profession.
          </p>

          <p>
            Br. Tabichi, a science teacher and Franciscan friar, has been praised for his dedication to his students and
            his community. He donates 80% of his monthly income to help the poor and has transformed education at
            Keriko Secondary School through innovative teaching methods and dedication.
          </p>

          <h2>Transforming Education Through Science</h2>
          <p>
            Under his guidance, students have excelled in both national and international science competitions,
            including the Kenya Science and Engineering Fair and the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.
            His students have developed devices to help the blind and deaf, and a method to harness plant-generated electricity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite facing many challenges, including limited resources and a high student-teacher ratio,
            Br. Tabichi has shown what can be achieved through dedication, innovation, and hard work.
          </p>

          <h2>Global Recognition</h2>
          <p>
            The Global Teacher Prize is awarded by the Varkey Foundation and is considered the Nobel Prize of teaching.
            Br. Tabichi was selected from over 10,000 nominations and applications from 179 countries around the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            "This prize does not recognize me but recognizes this great continent's young people," said Tabichi.
            "I am only here because of what my students have achieved. This prize gives them a chance.
            It tells the world that they can do anything."
